# Internet-Game-Enhancer
A PowerShellscript for Microsoft Windows (Windows 10 and later) to enhance your gameplay. You might be like me who can sometimes have bad internet for no reason, and your game client can crash because of that. Well this PowerShell script is used to clear your DNS cache every 2 minutes (you can change it if you want to).

# Requirements
If you have the old legacy PowerShell (PowerShell 1 or 2) on your Windows system. Then I recommend you install the latest version PowerShell Core from the offical Github Repository here: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell

# Instructions
If you have the latest version of PowerShell Core installed onto your system. Then run the file by entering:
* ./clear_dns.ps1
* pwsh clear_dns.ps1
